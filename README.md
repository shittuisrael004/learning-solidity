# Learning Solidity

## With Patrick Collins and Smart Contract Programmer

Currently learning solidity

Tracking and updating my solidity progress with this github repository

I'll recommend that as a beginner, you should paste the codes on remix and check them out so you understand better

    ```solidity
    function sayHello() public pure returns(string memory){
        return "Hello";
    }
    ```

Sample contract saying 'Hello'.
